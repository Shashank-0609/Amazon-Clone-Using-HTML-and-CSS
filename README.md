1. Download all of the files, or clone all of the repository.
2. Open up the `index.html` file now. Any of the browsers can be used for this.
3. Confirm image assets are present inside the same directory (like `amazon-logo.png`, `box1.jpg`, etc.).

This static frontend clone does not include backend functionality or interactivity.

This is a project with the aim only to educate. Commercial use is not the intention of this project.
